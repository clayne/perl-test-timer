* All code has been run through [Perl::Tidy](https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Tidy)

## 2.11 2019-09-06T17:43:07Z Maintenance release, update not required

* Applied PR [#23](https://github.com/jonasbn/perl-test-timer/pulls/16) with POD improvements from Mohammad S Anwar

## 2.10 2019-02-19T16:13:40Z Maintenance release, update not required

## 2.09 2017-11-24 Maintenance release, update not required

* Attempting to address issues with [tests on Windows](http://www.cpantesters.org/distro/T/Test-Timer.html?grade=3&perlmat=2&patches=2&oncpan=2&distmat=2&perlver=ALL&osname=ALL&version=2.08)

* Reinstated `sleep` over `select` in the test suite

* Changed some test parameters was made a bit less relaxed attempting to decrease the execution time
  for the test suite

* Removed loose match in regular, it should be possible to anticipate the timeout

* Removed redundant tests, trying to cut down execution time for the test suite

## 2.08 2017-11-20 Maintenance release, update not required

* Addressing reports on failing tests from CPAN testers

## 2.07 2017-11-18 Maintenance release, update not required

* Addressing issue [#17](https://github.com/jonasbn/perl-test-timer/issues/17), the tests are now more liberal, so when executed on smokers, CI environments and similar, load will not influence the test results. The requirement for [Test::Tester](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Tester) has been updated and a patch required by this distribution has been included

## 2.06 2017-11-14 Maintenance release, update not required

* Added cancellation of alarm, based on advice from Erik Johansen

* Implemented own `sleep`, based on `select`, this might address possible issues with
  `sleep` implementations

## 2.05 2017-11-12 Maintenance release, update not required

* Addressed issue [#11](https://github.com/jonasbn/perl-test-timer/issues/11) adding experimental graphical support elements to the documentation

## 2.04 2017-10-15 Maintenance release, update not required

* Minor improvements to Test::Timer::TimeoutException, some obsoleted code could
  be removed

* Generalising test asserting, since CPAN testers are sometime constrained on resources,
  making it impossible to predict the actual timeout value, see [example](http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/2561e32c-9efa-11e7-bc90-bbe42ddde1fb)

* Correction of spelling mistake via PR [#16](https://github.com/jonasbn/perl-test-timer/pulls/16) from Gregor Herrmann of the Debian Perl Group

## 2.01 2017-06-12 Bug fix release, update recommended

* Fixed bug where execution/time would be reported as `0`, ref: issue [#13](https://github.com/jonasbn/perl-test-timer/issues/13)

## 2.00 2017-06-06 Feature release, update recommended

* Improved diagnostics based on feedback for change introduced in 1.00
  from Nigel Horne. The actual measured time used is now presented, ref: issue [#12](https://github.com/jonasbn/perl-test-timer/issues/12)

* private subroutine `_runtest_atleast` factored out, ref: [#9](https://github.com/jonasbn/perl-test-timer/issues/9)

## 1.00 2017-06-03 Feature release, update recommended

* Implemented suggestion for improvement from Nigel Horne [#10](https://github.com/jonasbn/perl-test-timer/issues/10)

  This change impacts all the diagnostics, so these now communicate the relevant specified thresholds

* Added [Dist::Zilla](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla) plugins requirements causing issues to `dist.ini`, so these are explicitly specified

* Exchanged CJMÂ´s: [Dist::Zilla::Plugin::VersionFromModule](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::VersionFromModule) for Dave Rolskys: [Dist::Zilla::Plugin::VersionFromMainModule](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::VersionFromMainModule)
